**The Role of Supplements in Fitness: Boosting Performance and Recovery**

In the realm of fitness and health, supplements have become a staple for many athletes and fitness enthusiasts. Promising enhanced performance, improved recovery, and overall better health, supplements can be both beneficial and confusing. This comprehensive guide will explore the role of supplements in fitness, helping you navigate the vast market and choose what truly benefits your goals.

### Understanding Supplements: What Are They?

Supplements cover a wide range of products designed to augment your diet and provide nutrients that may be missing or insufficient. They include:
